    <h2>How to make macaroons</h2>

    <p>This mouth-watering recipe is ready in just 30 minutes and the ingredients detailed below can serve up to 12 people.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>3 egg whites</li>
        <li>¼ cup white sugar

        </li>
        <li>1 ⅔ cups confectioners' sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup finely ground almonds</li>
        <li>milk and love</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Line a baking sheet with a silicone baking mat.

        </li>
        <li>Beat egg whites in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment until foamy. Add white sugar and beat until egg whites are glossy, fluffy, and hold soft peaks.</li>
        <li>Sift confectioners' sugar and ground almonds in a separate bowl; quickly fold almond mixture into egg whites, about 30 strokes.

        </li>
        <li>Spoon a small amount of batter into a plastic bag with a small corner cut off and pipe a test disk of batter, about 1 1/2 inches in diameter, onto the prepared baking sheet. If the disk of batter holds a peak instead of flattening immediately, gently fold batter a few more times and retest.</li>
        <li>When batter is mixed enough to flatten immediately into an even disk, spoon into a pastry bag fitted with a plain round tip. Pipe batter onto the baking sheet in rounds, leaving space between the disks. Let piped cookies stand out at room temperature until they form a hard skin on top, about 1 hour.</li>
    </ol>
