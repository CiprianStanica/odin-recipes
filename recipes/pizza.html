    <h2>Better than delivery, every time! Here are the best pizza recipes, with top-rated pizza dough, sauces, and topping ideas galore.</h2>

    <p>Our honeymoon to Italy changed the way we thought about pizza. Alex and I realized that artisan pizza recipes can be incredible, healthy, and simple to make at home. All you need is a great pizza sauce, minimal toppings, and a few specialized tools. Oh and most importantly, you need a great pizza dough. After all these years, we can guarantee: ours are some of the best pizza recipes you’ll find. Ready to get started? Here are our master recipes, pizza gear, and the top pizza recipes to make at home.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>1/2 yellow bell pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 red bell pepper</li>
        <li>1/4 medium red onion</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon dried oregano, plus more for garnish</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Make the pizza dough: Follow the Easy Thin Crust Pizza Dough recipe to prepare the dough. (This takes about 15 minutes to make and 45 minutes to rest.)</li>
        <li> Place a pizza stone in the oven and preheat to 500°F. OR preheat your pizza oven (here’s the pizza oven we use). </li>
        <li>Make the pizza sauce: Make the Easy Pizza Sauce.</li>
        <li>Prepare the toppings: Thinly slice the peppers. Thinly slice the red onion. Thinly slice the garlic. In a skillet, add 1 tablespoon olive oil and ¼ teaspoon kosher salt. Saute the vegetables, stirring often, for about 7 to 10 minutes, until browned and very soft. Stir in the oregano and remove from the heat.</li>
        <li>Bake the pizza: When the oven is ready, dust a pizza peel with cornmeal or semolina flour. (If you dont have a pizza peel, you can use a rimless baking sheet or the back of a rimmed baking sheet. But a pizza peel is well worth the investment!) Stretch the dough into a circle; see How to Stretch Pizza Dough for instructions. Then gently place the dough onto the pizza peel.</li>
