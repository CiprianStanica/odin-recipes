    <h2 class="h2"><span> How to make guacamole</span></h2>

    <p class="description">This is the best version of this classic guacamole dip. The ingredients are kept to a minimum, so it's as fresh-tasting as possible.</p>

    <h2 class="h2"><span>Ingredients</span></h2>

    <ul class="ingredients">
        
        <li>3 avocados, very ripe but not bruised</li>
        <li>handful coriander, leaves and stalks chopped, plus a few leaves, roughly chopped, to serve</li>
        <li>1 small red onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 chilli, red or green, deseeded and finely chopped</li>
        <li>tortilla chips, to serve</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="h2"><span>Steps </span></h2>

    <ol class="Steps">
        <li>
            Use a large knife to pulverise 1 large ripe tomato to a pulp on a board, then tip into a bowl.</li>
        <li>
            Halve and stone the 3 avocados (saving a stone) and use a spoon to scoop out the flesh into the bowl with the tomato.</li>
        <li>
            Tip the juice of 1 large lime, a handful of roughly chopped coriander, 1 finely chopped small red onion and 1 deseeded and finely chopped red or green chilli into the bowl, then season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>
            Use a whisk to roughly mash everything together. If not serving straight away, sit a stone in the guacamole (this helps to stop it going brown), cover with cling film and chill until needed.</li>
        <li>
            Fcking eat it
        </li>
    </ol>
